/**
 * SWIM - Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group
 * Membership Protocol. It consists of 2 components: events
 * dissemination and failure detection, and stores in memory a
 * table of known remote hosts - members. Also some SWIM
 * implementations have an additional component: anti-entropy -
 * periodical broadcast of a random subset of members table.
 *
 * Each SWIM component is different from others in both message
 * structures and goals, they even could be sent in different
 * messages. But SWIM describes piggybacking of messages: a ping
 * message can piggyback a dissemination's one. SWIM has a main
 * operating cycle during which it randomly chooses members from a
 * member table and sends them events + ping. Answers are
 * processed out of the main cycle asynchronously.
 *
 * Random selection provides even network load about ~1 message to
 * each member regardless of the cluster size. Without randomness
 * a member would get a network load of N messages each protocol
 * step, since all other members will choose the same member on
 * each step where N is the cluster size.
 *
 * Also SWIM describes a kind of fairness: when selecting a next
 * member to ping, the protocol prefers LRU members. In code it
 * would too complicated, so Tarantool's implementation is
 * slightly different, easier.
 *
 * Tarantool splits protocol operation into rounds. At the
 * beginning of a round all members are randomly reordered and
 * linked into a list. At each round step a member is popped from
 * the list head, a message is sent to him, and he waits for the
 * next round. In such implementation all random selection of the
 * original SWIM is executed once per round. The round is
 * 'planned' actually. A list is used instead of an array since
 * new members can be added to its tail without realloc, and dead
 * members can be removed as easy as that.
 *
 * Also Tarantool implements third component - anti-entropy. Why
 * is it needed and even vital? Consider the example: two SWIM
 * nodes, both are alive. Nothing happens, so the events list is
 * empty, only pings are being sent periodically. Then a third
 * node appears. It knows about one of existing nodes. How should
 * it learn about another one? Sure, its known counterpart can try
 * to notify another one, but it is UDP, so this event can lost.
 * Anti-entropy is an extra simple component, it just piggybacks
 * random part of members table with each regular ping. In the
 * example above the new node will learn about the third one via
 * anti-entropy messages of the second one soon or late.
 */

 * introducing one more implementation of mhash.
 *
 * Discovered members live here until they are unavailable - in
